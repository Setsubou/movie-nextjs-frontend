This project is made in conjunction with its [Backend Counterpart](https://github.com/Setsubou/movie-go-backend/)

# Setting up Environment Variable

First, take a copy of `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`.

Then fill out the information needed with the web app port and the API server address.

# Installing dependencies

Install the required dependencies by typing

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```
# Backend Server
Make sure that API Server is up and running, otherwise web app wouldn't be able to do anything.

# Running web app
Type this into the terminal to start the server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Terminal will tell you once the server is running along with its URL.
